Hello and thank you for checking out this blog, I'm so excited to share what I've been working on! But before I dive into talking about what Handsfree.js is and how you can get started, I thought I'd show you some things I've made with it first!

## Examples

### Use it to trigger events

Just today I released the [Pincher Plugin](https://handsfree.js.org/ref/plugin/pinchers.html) which emits 24+ pinching events with 3 states - `start`, `held`, `released` - for pinching with your index, middle, ring, and pinky fingers. It's modelled after the Mouse Events and you can listen to them similarly with `document.addEventListener()`: https://handsfree.js.org/ref/plugin/pinchers.html

### Use it to scroll pages handsfree

Here's a Browser Extension I'm working on that helps you scroll websites handsfree. It uses the [MediaPipe Hands model](https://handsfree.js.org/ref/model/hands.html) to track your hands. This GIF was actually really easy to make with the built in `pinchScroll plugin`, which enables this customizable functionality in a single line of code: https://handsfree.js.org/ref/plugin/pinchScroll.html

### Use it to create new kinds of Assistive Technologies

This is one of my favorites, and it uses the ["Face Pointer" plugin](https://handsfree.js.org/ref/plugin/facePointer.html) to allow you to move a pointer with your face, scroll pages, and click on things. It's powered by the [Jeeliz Weboji model](https://handsfree.js.org/ref/model/weboji.html)

### Use it to control desktop games

Here's me playing "Into the Breach" on my desktop with Face Pointers and Hand Pointers. These are super easy to make too, all I did was use the Face and Hand Pointer plugins and then stream them over to my desktop with [Robot.js](https://robotjs.io/) to trigger native mouse events:

### Use it to make your own games

But why just play games when you can make them too!? Here are a few games I've made, which I plan on grouping together into a "Mario Party" like game where you roll dice to move on a board and then play minigames with your friends at the end of each round.

Here is "DuckFace Hunt", "Flappy Pose", and "Handsfree Jenga":

### Use it to control robots and drones

Of course, you're not limited to controlling things on the web or even desktop. With WebSockets you control anything connected to your computer, like this Universal Robot which I tried to puppeteer with my own head:

### Use it for art, music, and other experiences

There's so much more that you can do! Here are some other experiments like my Handsfree Psychedelic Art Maker and WebXR DevTools so that you can work on WebXR apps without XR equipment:
